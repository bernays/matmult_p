When reading in a matrix matmult_p and matmult_t both perform the following error checks on the input matrix:
	Check that 2 matrixes exist
	Check for a jagged matrix
	Check that the dimensions are correct to multiply



To run (spaces in command line are important):


 $  ./matmult_p < matrix.c | ./matformatter
